# Java Logic Practice Exercises üß†üíª

This repository contains a small collection of beginner-friendly Java exercises designed to improve logic, problem-solving, and familiarity with core Java features like loops, collections, and console input.

## üìÇ Exercises Included

### 1. üß∫ Inventory Value Sorter

Calculates the total value of products in an inventory based on quantity and unit price.

### 3. üìö Vocabulary Comparison with Sets
Given two text strings, this program:

Finds unique words in each text

Finds words in common

Returns all words sorted alphabetically (without duplicates)

```java
Only A: [a, hello, is, test, this]
Only B: [and, more, of, tests, text]
Common: [world]
All sorted: [a, and, hello, is, more, of, test, tests, text, this, world]
```

### 4. ‚ûï Integer Sum with Swing

A simple graphical interface that allows users to add two integer numbers.
If a non-numeric value is entered, an error message is displayed.

Features:

- Built with JFrame, JTextField, JButton, and JLabel

- Uses a lambda expression for the ActionListener event

- Includes exception handling with NumberFormatException for validation

Example (visual):
```java
[ 4 ] + [ 6 ] = 10
```

If invalid input is entered:
```java
You must enter an integer number.
```
